\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
The impact of climate change on natural and human systems 
is increasingly apparent \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Increases in global average 
surface temperatures, sea levels, and larger climate extremes
are a few consequences brought on by elevated \gls{GHG} 
concentrations \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Energy use and production contribute to 
two-thirds of the total \gls{GHG}
emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Furthermore, as the human population increases and previously 
under-developed nations rapidly urbanize, 
global energy demand is forecasted to increase.  
Energy generation technology selection 
profoundly impacts climate change via growing energy demand. 
Large scale deployment of emissions free nuclear power plants 
could significantly reduce GHG production 
\cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.  

However, large scale nuclear power deployment faces
challenges of cost and safety \cite{petti_future_2018}. 
The nuclear power industry must overcome these challenges 
to ensure continued global use and expansion 
of nuclear energy technology.

% everytime a nuclear reactor is built, it is a new design etc. etc.
