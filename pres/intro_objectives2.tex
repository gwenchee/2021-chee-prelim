    \begin{block}{Technical Gap}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Applying evolutionary algorithms to nuclear design problems is not new,
        however, evolutionary algorithm setup is highly customizable, A reactor 
        designer unfamiliar with evolutionary algorithms will have to go through 
        the cumbersome process of customizing a genetic algorithm for their
        needs and determine which operators and hyperparameters work best for their problem
      \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Proposed Work Component II: Develop and demonstrate an evolutionary 
        algorithm optimization tool for multi-objective AHTR optimization of 
        non-conventional geometries and fuel distribution}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Objectives
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Develop a tool that applies evolutionary algorithms with established 
            neutron transport and thermal hydraulics software to optimize reactor 
            design. The tool must be open-source, reproducible, effective, usable,
            and supports HPC parallelization. 
            \item Demonstrate successful implementation of the optimization tool 
            with OpenMC for single and multi-objective AHTR optimization
        \end{itemize}
