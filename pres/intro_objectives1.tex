  \begin{block}{Technical Gap}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The triple heterogeneity introduced by the geometrically complex 
      fuel assembly design makes accurate reactor physics simulations challenging. 
      Thus requiring a need to access accuracy of such analyses 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Proposed Work Component I: AHTR Model Development}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I aim to further our understanding of the AHTR design's complexities 
      through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling.
      \item I will participate in the OECD-NEA's FHR Benchmarking exercise with 
      OpenMC and Moltres
      \item Objectives 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item AHTR 2D and 3D assembly neutronics steady state and depletion models 
        with neutron transport software, OpenMC
        \item AHTR 2D fuel plank and assembly neutronics with thermal hydraulics 
        feedback using Moltres
      \end{itemize}
