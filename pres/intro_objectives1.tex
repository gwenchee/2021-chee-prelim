  \begin{block}{Technical Gap}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The triple heterogeneity introduced by the geometrically complex 
      fuel assembly design makes accurate reactor physics simulations challenging. 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Proposed Work Component I: AHTR Model Development}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Further our understanding of the AHTR design's complexities 
      through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling
      \item Participate in the OECD-NEA's FHR Benchmark with 
      OpenMC and Moltres
      %\item Objectives 
      %\begin{itemize}
      %  \item AHTR 2D and 3D assembly neutronics steady state and depletion models 
      %  with neutron transport software, OpenMC
      %  \item AHTR 2D fuel plank and assembly neutronics with thermal hydraulics 
      %  feedback using Moltres
