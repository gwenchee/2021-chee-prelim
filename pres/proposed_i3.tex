    \frametitle{Planned Stage I-3: FHR Benchmark Phase I-C and II Goals}
    \begin{block}{Phase I-C}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The FHR benchmark's Phase I-C extends the 2D assembly model from 
            Phases I-A and I-B into a 3D assembly model. The benchmark organizers 
            will release the Phase I-C detailed specifications and required results 
            in late 2021.
            \item When the specifications are released, I will contribute Phase I-C
            results to the benchmark. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Preliminary Phase II}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item FHR Benchmark Phase II: 3D full core steady state and depletion 
            models 
            \item For preliminary work towards Phase II, I will expand the AHTR model 
            from assembly to full core 
        \end{itemize}
