    \frametitle{Planned Stage I-3: FHR Benchmark Phase I-C Planned Work}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item FHR benchmark's Phase I-C extends the 2D assembly model from 
            Phases I-A and I-B into a 3D assembly model
            \item Benchmark organizers will release the Phase I-C detailed 
            specifications and required results in late 2021
            \item When the specifications are released, I will contribute Phase I-C
            results to the benchmark
        \end{itemize}
