\section{Motivation}
The impact of climate change on natural and human systems caused by 
elevated \gls{GHG} concentrations is increasingly apparent by increases 
in global average surface temperatures, sea levels, and severe weather events 
\cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Energy use and production contribute to two-thirds of total \gls{GHG}
emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Furthermore, as the human population increases and previously underdeveloped 
nations rapidly urbanize, global energy demand will continue to rise.  
Because energy generation technology selection profoundly impacts climate change, 
large scale deployment of emissions-free nuclear power plants could 
significantly reduce GHG production, but faces challenges of cost and safety 
\cite{noauthor_climate_2018, petti_future_2018}. 
The nuclear power industry must overcome these challenges to ensure continued 
global use and expansion of nuclear energy technology to provide low-carbon 
electricity worldwide.
To enhance the role of nuclear energy in our global energy 
ecosystem, the Generation IV International Forum was created to lead and plan 
research and development to support a new and innovative Generation IV of
nuclear energy systems \cite{gif_technology_2002}.
Generation IV nuclear systems' goals are defined in four areas: sustainability, 
economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance and physical 
protection \cite{gif_technology_2002}. 
Table \ref{tab:goals-gen4} summarizes the goals in each area.

The Generation IV International Forum's methodology working groups developed 
an evaluation and selection methodology based on these goals, 
culminating in selecting six Generation IV systems: \gls{GFR}, 
\gls{LFR}, \gls{MSR}, \gls{SFR}, \gls{SCWR}, and \gls{VHTR} 
\cite{gif_technology_2002}. 
This proposed work will consider the \gls{MSR} and \gls{VHTR} systems. 
The MSR system produces fission power in a circulating molten salt fuel mixture. 
It has a closed fuel cycle tailored to the efficient utilization of plutonium 
and minor actinides. 
Molten fluoride salts have very low vapor pressure, which reduces stress on the 
system. 
MSR systems also have inherent system safety due to fail-safe drainage, 
passive cooling, and a low inventory of volatile fission products in the fuel. 
The MSR system is top-ranked in sustainability because of its closed fuel cycle 
and excellent waste burndown performance. 
It rates good in safety and proliferation resistance and physical protection, 
due to its inherent safety features, and rates neutrally in economics because of
its large number of subsystems \cite{gif_technology_2002}.  
The \gls{VHTR} system has a once-through uranium cycle and is primarily aimed at 
high-temperature heat applications, such as hydrogen production. 
It is a graphite-moderated, helium-cooled reactor that uses \gls{TRISO} fuel, 
which does not degrade at high burnup and temperature.  
The \gls{VHTR} system is highly ranked in economics because of its high hydrogen 
production efficiency, high safety and reliability, and inherent safety features 
of the fuel and reactor. 
It rates well in proliferation resistance and physical protection and 
neutrally in sustainability because of its open fuel cycle \cite{gif_technology_2002}. 

In the proposed work, we explore the \gls{FHR} concept, which 
is a combination of the best aspects of \gls{MSR} and \gls{VHTR} technologies. 
The \gls{FHR} uses high-temperature coated-particle fuel (similar to the \gls{VHTR}) 
and a low-pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant (similar to the \gls{MSR})
\cite{forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012,facilitators_fluoride-salt-cooled_2013}.

In recent years, \gls{AM} technology, popularly known as `3D printing', 
has advanced and altered the manufacturing and design of components 
\cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 
The automotive and aircraft industries have successfully fabricated parts with 
key \gls{AM} technologies relevant to nuclear reactor core 
structures \cite{murr_frontiers_2016}.  
For example, Boeing successfully used \gls{AM} to reduce weight 
in the 787 Dreamliner \cite{noauthor_printed_2017} and SES-15 spacecraft 
\cite{noauthor_boeing_nodate}. 
Successful \gls{AM} applications in the aerospace industry are 
promising for the nuclear industry since both are highly regulated. 
Using \gls{AM} to fabricate nuclear reactor components will 
drastically reduce cost and timelines, and increase safety and performance by 
tailoring local material properties and redesigning geometries for optimal load paths 
\cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 

With further advancement of \gls{AM} technologies, a reactor 
core could be 3D printed in the near future. 
\gls{ORNL} is leading this initiative through the 2019 \gls{TCR} Demonstration 
Program. 
The \gls{TCR} program will leverage recent scientific achievements in advanced 
manufacturing, nuclear materials, machine learning, and computational modeling 
and simulation to build a microreactor. 
The program aims to design, manufacture, and operate a demonstration reactor 
by 2023 \cite{terrani_transformational_2019}. 
% explore funky designs :D 
Applying \gls{AM} to nuclear reactor design will free complex 
reactor geometries from previous manufacturing constraints,
opening the door for a re-examination of nuclear reactor optimization 
\cite{sobes_artificial_2020}. 
Optimization efforts towards classically manufactured nuclear reactors, and now
3D printed nuclear reactors, have focused on parameters such as radius of the 
core, height of cylinder, enrichment of fuel, etc 
\cite{sobes_artificial_2020,sacco_two_2006,kumar_new_2015,pereira_parallel_2008}. 
Leveraging \gls{AM} technology enables us to surpass classical 
manufacturing constraints, such as straight fuel channels or homogenous fuel 
enrichment, and optimize for arbitrary geometries and parameters 
such as non-uniform channel shapes, and inhomogeneous fuel distribution throughout 
the core. 

Multi-objective design problems inevitably require a trade-off between 
desirable attributes \cite{byrne_evolving_2014,simon_sciences_2019}. 
In nuclear reactor design, one example is the trade-off between neutron economy 
and fuel enrichment.
A reactor design must have sufficient neutron economy to ensure criticality but 
also have a low fuel enrichment to reduce proliferation risk. 
Conflicting objectives means that there is no \textit{one} perfect solution but 
a \textit{set} of equally optimal solutions \cite{byrne_evolving_2014}.
Multi-objective problems are challenging to optimize; therefore, they cannot be 
handled by classical optimization methods, such as gradient methods, because only 
the local optimum will be found \cite{renner_genetic_2003}. 
\Glspl{EA} have proven successful methods to optimize 
multi-objective problems \cite{krish_practical_2011}, as 
they can find a solution near the global optimum \cite{renner_genetic_2003}.
They also take advantage of parallel systems for reduced computational cost.
The most popular \glspl{EA} used to solve multi-objective 
problems are genetic algorithms \cite{byrne_evolving_2014, krish_practical_2011},
which imitate natural selection to evolve solutions by (1) maintaining a 
population of solutions, (2) allowing fitter solutions to reproduce, and (3) 
letting lesser fit solutions die off, resulting in final solutions that are 
better than the previous generations \cite{renner_genetic_2003}. 

Therefore, in this work, we propose designing an optimization tool that uses 
the \gls{EA} optimization technique with nuclear transport and 
thermal-hydraulics software. 
This tool will be used to explore nonuniform FHR reactor core parameters, now 
possible with \gls{AM} technology, to optimize reactor systems 
fully. 

\section{Objectives}
We developed the proposed work's main objectives based on leveraging 
open-source artificial intelligence tools with validated open-source nuclear 
transport and thermal-hydraulics software to create an open-source tool which 
generates optimal reactor designs quickly. 
Accordingly, the objectives are listed below:

\vspace{0.2cm} 
\noindent
\textbf{Model the \gls{FHR} with established 
nuclear transport and thermal-hydraulics software}.
To demonstrate success in modeling the \gls{FHR} with nuclear transport and 
thermal-hydraulics software before using the optimization tool, we will 
participate in the \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA}'s \gls{FHR} benchmark 
\cite{noauthor_fluoride_nodate}. 

\vspace{0.2cm} 
\noindent
\textbf{Develop a tool that applies evolutionary algorithms to optimize nuclear 
reactor design}. 
This tool will not reinvent the wheel---it will utilize a well-documented 
and validated open-source \gls{EA} Python package with established 
nuclear transport and thermal-hydraulics software. This tool will run parallel on 
\gls{HPC} machines, be open-source, and follow the rules for ensuring 
reproducibility, effectiveness, and usability 
\cite{list_ten_2017,osborne_ten_2014,sandve_ten_2013}. 

\vspace{0.2cm} 
\noindent
\textbf{Optimize a nuclear reactor design with the optimization tool and a 
neutronics software}. 
We will demonstrate successful implementation of the optimization tool with a
nuclear transport software by optimizing a simple \gls{FHR} model for a single 
objective function. 

\vspace{0.2cm} 
\noindent
\textbf{Tune hyperparameters with the optimization tool for a neutronics problem}.
Hyperparameter selection will impact the effectiveness of the algorithm 
for our problem. 
Therefore, we must conduct a hyperparameter search to find ones that work best 
for our problem. 

\vspace{0.2cm} 
\noindent
\textbf{Demonstrate nuclear reactor design optimization and hyperparameter 
search with the optimization tool for a neutronics and thermal-hydraulics problem}.
We will demonstrate successful implementation of the optimization tool and 
hyperparameter tuning with the nuclear transport and thermal-hydraulics tools 
for a \gls{FHR} model.
