\section{Motivation}
Increased global average surface temperatures, sea levels, and severe weather 
events caused by elevated \gls{GHG} concentrations show the substantial 
negative impact of climate change on natural and human systems
\cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Energy use and production contribute two-thirds of total \gls{GHG}
emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Furthermore, as the human population increases and previously underdeveloped 
nations rapidly industrialize, global energy demand will continue to rise.  
Because energy generation technology selection profoundly impacts climate change, 
large scale emissions-free nuclear power deployment could 
significantly reduce GHG production but faces both cost and perceived adverse 
safety challenges \cite{noauthor_climate_2018, petti_future_2018}. 
The nuclear power industry must overcome these challenges to ensure continued 
global use and expansion of nuclear energy technology to provide low-carbon 
electricity worldwide.
The Generation IV International Forum aims to enhance the role of 
nuclear energy in our global energy ecosystem by leading and planning 
research and development to support a new and innovative Generation IV
nuclear energy systems \cite{gif_technology_2002}.
Generation IV nuclear systems target goals in four areas: sustainability, 
economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance and physical 
protection \cite{gif_technology_2002}. 
Table \ref{tab:goals-gen4} summarizes the goals in each area.

The Generation IV International Forum's methodology working groups developed 
an evaluation and selection methodology based on these goals 
and correspondingly selected six Generation IV systems: \glspl{GFR}, 
\glspl{LFR}, \glspl{MSR}, \glspl{SFR}, \glspl{SCWR}, and \glspl{VHTR} 
\cite{gif_technology_2002}. 
This proposed work will consider the \gls{MSR} and \gls{VHTR} systems. 

\gls{MSR} systems produce fission power in a circulating molten salt fuel mixture. 
It has a closed fuel cycle tailored to the efficient utilization of plutonium 
and minor actinides. 
Researchers recommend molten fluoride salts because they have high uranium solubility, 
chemical stability, very low vapor pressure even at high temperatures, good heat 
transfer properties, resistance against radiation damage, and are inert to common
structural materials \cite{rosenthal_molten-salt_1970}.  
Molten fluoride salts' low vapor pressure ensures reduced stress on the system. 
MSR systems also incorporate inherent system safety with fail-safe drainage, 
passive cooling, and a low inventory of volatile fission products in the fuel. 
\gls{MSR} systems closed fuel cycle and excellent waste burndown performance 
make it top-ranked in sustainability. 
They rate well in safety and proliferation resistance and physical protection, 
due to their inherent safety features, and rate neutrally in economics because of
their large number of subsystems \cite{gif_technology_2002}.  

\gls{VHTR} systems use a once-through uranium cycle and leverage their 
high outlet temperature for high-temperature heat applications, such as hydrogen 
production. 
Graphite-moderated and helium-cooled, \glspl{VHTR} use \gls{TRISO} fuel
which withstands high burnup and temperature \cite{gif_technology_2002}.  
\gls{VHTR} systems' high hydrogen production efficiency, high safety and 
reliability, and inherent fuel and reactor safety features make it highly 
ranked in economics. 
An open fuel cycle results in \gls{VHTR} systems' ranking well in proliferation 
resistance and physical protection and neutrally in sustainability 
\cite{gif_technology_2002}. 

In the proposed PhD work, I will work on modeling and optimization of the 
\gls{FHR} concept, which combines the best aspects of \gls{MSR} and \gls{VHTR} 
technologies. 
\glspl{FHR} use high-temperature coated-particle fuel (similar to the \glspl{VHTR}) 
and a low-pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant (similar to the \glspl{MSR})
\cite{forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012,facilitators_fluoride-salt-cooled_2013}.
The proposed work focuses on a prismatic \gls{FHR} design with hexagonal fuel 
assemblies consisting of \gls{TRISO} fuel particles embedded in planks, i.e., 
the \gls{AHTR} design.
The \gls{AHTR}'s fuel geometry has \emph{triple heterogeneity} resulting in 
complex reactor physics and significant modeling challenges 
\cite{petrovic_benchmark_2021}. 
To further understand and address the technical challenges associated with the 
\gls{AHTR} design, I will participate in the \gls{OECD}-\gls{NEA}'s \gls{FHR} 
benchmarking exercise \cite{petrovic_benchmark_2021}.

In the proposed PhD work, I will also explore the impact of 
additive manufacturing technology advancements on reactor geometry
optimization, specifically for the \gls{AHTR} design.
In recent years, additive manufacturing technology, popularly known as `3D printing', 
has advanced and altered the manufacturing and design of engineered hardware
\cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 
The automotive and aircraft industries have successfully fabricated car and 
airplane components with key additive manufacturing technologies that are 
relevant to nuclear reactor core structures \cite{murr_frontiers_2016}.  
The highly-regulated aerospace industry's successful additive manufacturing 
applications, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's 3-D printed structural titanium 
parts that reduced titanium alloy required while maintaining structural integrity
\cite{noauthor_printed_2017}, show promise for applying additive manufacturing 
technologies to the also highly-regulated nuclear industry.  
Using additive manufacturing to fabricate nuclear reactor components could 
drastically reduce cost and timelines, and increase safety and performance by 
tailoring local material properties and redesigning for optimal geometries
\cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 

With further advancement of additive manufacturing technologies, a reactor 
core could be 3D printed within the next decade. 
\gls{ORNL} leads this initiative through the 2019 \gls{TCR} Demonstration 
Program. 
The \gls{TCR} program will leverage recent scientific achievements in advanced 
manufacturing, nuclear materials, machine learning, and computational modeling 
and simulation to build a microreactor. 
The program aims to design, manufacture, and operate a demonstration reactor 
by 2023 \cite{terrani_transformational_2019}. 
% explore funky designs :D 
Applying additive manufacturing to nuclear reactor design will free complex 
reactor geometries from previous manufacturing constraints,
opening the door for a re-examination of nuclear reactor optimization 
\cite{sobes_artificial_2020}. 
Optimization efforts towards classically manufactured nuclear reactors, and now
3D printed nuclear reactors have focused on parameters such as core radius, 
cylinder height, fuel enrichment, etc 
\cite{sobes_artificial_2020,sacco_two_2006,kumar_new_2015,pereira_parallel_2008}. 
Leveraging additive manufacturing technology enables us to surpass classical 
manufacturing constraints, such as straight fuel channels or homogenous fuel 
enrichment, and optimize for arbitrary geometries and parameters 
such as non-uniform channel shapes, and inhomogeneous fuel distribution 
throughout the core. 

Multi-objective design problems, such as reactor design optimization, 
inevitably require a trade-off between desirable attributes 
\cite{byrne_evolving_2014,simon_sciences_2019}. 
For example, the neutron economy and fuel enrichment trade-off in nuclear 
reactor design. 
A reactor design should maximize neutron economy and minimize fuel enrichment 
to reduce proliferation risk and cost. 
Conflicting objectives results in no \textit{one} perfect solution but 
a \textit{set} of equally optimal solutions \cite{byrne_evolving_2014}.
Multi-objective problems are challenging to optimize; therefore, they cannot be 
handled by classical optimization methods, such as gradient methods, which may 
find local optima while missing the global optimum \cite{renner_genetic_2003}. 
Evolutionary algorithms have proven successful in optimizing multi-objective problems 
\cite{krish_practical_2011}, as they can find solutions at the global 
optimum \cite{renner_genetic_2003}.
They also take advantage of parallel systems for reduced computational cost.
Genetic algorithms are the most frequently used evolutionary algorithms for 
solving multi-objective problems \cite{byrne_evolving_2014, krish_practical_2011}.
Genetic algorithms imitate natural selection to evolve solutions by 
\cite{renner_genetic_2003}: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item maintaining a population of solutions
    \item allowing more optimal solutions to reproduce
    \item letting less optimal solutions die off, resulting in final solutions that are 
    better than the previous generations
\end{enumerate} 

To enable the use of evolutionary algorithms for reactor design optimization,
I designed an optimization tool that uses the evolutionary algorithm optimization 
technique with neutron transport and thermal-hydraulics software to find flexible, 
arbitrary, and optimal reactor geometries enabled by additive manufacturing technology. 
For proof of concept in this preliminary work, I demonstrate using the 
optimization tool to maximize $k_{eff}$ in an \gls{AHTR} fuel slab by varying 
fuel distribution. 
In the proposed PhD scope, I will further demonstrate using evolutionary 
algorithms for multi-objective \gls{AHTR} optimization of arbitrary geometries 
and fuel distribution, which are now possible with additive manufacturing 
technology. 

\section{Objectives}
My proposed PhD scope is split into two components. 
First, I aim to further our understanding of the \gls{AHTR} design's complexities 
through neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling. 
Second, I aim to leverage evolutionary algorithms to create an open-source tool 
which enables nuclear reactor design optimization for non-conventional reactor 
geometries and fuel distributions. 
I will demonstrate the tool through flexible \gls{AHTR} optimization problems.  
The proposed work's objectives are: 

\vspace{0.2cm} 
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\Roman*}]
\item \textbf{Model the \gls{FHR} with established neutron transport software, OpenMC}.
To demonstrate success in neutron transport modeling of the \gls{FHR} before 
using the optimization tool, I will participate in the \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA}'s 
\gls{FHR} benchmark \cite{noauthor_fluoride_nodate}. 
I will use the OpenMC neutron transport software \cite{romano_openmc_2013}. 

\item \textbf{Develop a tool that applies evolutionary algorithms to optimize nuclear 
reactor design}. 
This tool will not reinvent the wheel---it will utilize a well-documented 
and validated open-source evolutionary algorithm Python package with established 
neutron transport and thermal-hydraulics software. This tool will run parallel on 
\gls{HPC} machines, be open-source, and follow the rules for ensuring 
reproducibility, effectiveness, and usability 
\cite{list_ten_2017,osborne_ten_2014,sandve_ten_2013}. 

\item \textbf{Demonstrate optimization tool with a single objective AHTR 
design optimization problem}.
I will demonstrate successful implementation of the optimization tool with a
neutron transport software by optimizing an \gls{AHTR} fuel slab's fuel 
distribution for a single objective function. 

\item \textbf{Model the \gls{FHR} with established thermal-hydraulics software}.
To demonstrate success in thermal hydraulics modeling of the \gls{FHR} before 
using the optimization tool, I will participate in the \gls{OECD} \gls{NEA}'s 
\gls{FHR} benchmark \cite{noauthor_fluoride_nodate}. 
I will use Moltres, a MOOSE-based application for modeling coupled neutronics 
and thermal-hydraulics physics in \glspl{MSR}. 

\item \textbf{Demonstrate multi-objective nuclear reactor design optimizations 
for neutronics and thermal-hydraulics problems}.
To demonstrate successful use of the optimization tool for multi-objective 
\gls{AHTR} optimization, 
I will vary parameters such as reactor geometry and fuel distribution with 
objectives such as maximizing $k_{eff}$, maximizing heat transfer, and 
minimizing power peaking factor. 
\end{enumerate}

This preliminary work begins on objectives I, II, and III, which provides 
the basis and proof of concept for objectives IV and V.
