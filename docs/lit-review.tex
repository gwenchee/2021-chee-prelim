design optimization.

\section{Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor}
The \gls{FHR} is a reactor concept introduced in 2012 that uses high-temperature 
coated-particle fuel and a low-pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant 
\cite{forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012,facilitators_fluoride-salt-cooled_2013}.
\gls{FHR} technology combines the best aspects of \gls{MSR} and \gls{VHTR} 
(or \gls{HTGR}) technologies. 
Molten fluoride salts as working fluids for nuclear reactors have been explored 
since the 1960s and are desirable because of their high-temperature 
performance and overall chemical stability \cite{scarlat_design_2014}.  
Using molten salts for reactor coolant introduces inherent safety compared 
to water due to the salts' high boiling temperature and high volumetric 
heat capacity, eliminating the risk of coolant boiling off, resulting in 
fuel elements overheating \cite{ho_molten_2013}. 
The leading candidate coolant salt is the fluoride salt Li$_2$BeF$_4$ (FLiBe), 
which remains liquid without pressurization up to 1400 $^{\circ}$C and a larger 
$\rho C_p$ than water \cite{ho_molten_2013,forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012}. 
\glspl{FHR} are favorable compared to a liquid fuel reactor, such as
\gls{MSR} systems, because the solid fuel cladding adds an extra barrier to fission 
product release 
\cite{ho_molten_2013}.

\gls{VHTR} technology has been studied since the 1970s because it delivers 
heat at substantially high temperatures than \glspl{LWR}, resulting in 
the following advantages: increased power conversion efficiency, reduced 
waste heat generation, and co-generation and process heat capabilities 
\cite{scarlat_design_2014}. 
In \glspl{VHTR}, the helium coolant is held at a high pressure of approximately 
100 atm, whereas the \gls{FHR}'s FLiBe coolant is at room pressure, resulting in lower 
construction costs since a thick concrete reactor vessel is not required.
The molten salt coolant has superior cooling and moderating properties compared 
to helium coolant in \glspl{VHTR}, resulting in \glspl{FHR} operating at 
power densities two to six times higher than  \glspl{VHTR} 
\cite{scarlat_design_2014,forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012}.
Therefore, by combining the FLiBE coolant from \gls{MSR} technology and 
\gls{TRISO} particles from \gls{VHTR} technology, the \gls{FHR} benefits from 
the low operating pressure and large thermal margin provided by using a molten 
salt coolant and the accident-tolerant qualities of \gls{TRISO} particle fuel. 

Several types of \gls{FHR} conceptual designs exist worldwide: \gls{PBFHR} at 
UCB with circulating pebble-fuel 
\cite{scarlat_current_2014,krumwiede_three-dimensional_2013}, the \gls{SF-TMSR} 
at the \gls{SINAP} in China with static pebble-fuel \cite{liu_preliminary_2016}, 
the large central-station \gls{AHTR} at \gls{ORNL} \cite{holcomb_core_2011, varma_ahtr_2012} and 
the \gls{SmAHTR} at ORNL \cite{greene_pre-conceptual_2010} with static plate-fuel. 

\subsection{AHTR design}
This proposed work focuses on the \gls{FHR} design with hexagonal fuel elements 
consisting of \gls{TRISO} fuel particles embedded in plates ("planks"), i.e., the 
\gls{AHTR} design developed by ORNL. 
The \gls{AHTR} has 3400 MWt thermal power and 1400 MW electric power with
inlet/outlet temperatures of 650/700$^{\circ}C$ \cite{varma_ahtr_2012}.  
Figure \ref{fig:ahtr} shows the prismatic AHTR's fuel element and core 
configuration.  
Each hexagonal fuel element features plate-type fuel consisting of eighteen plates 
arranged in three diamond-shaped sectors, with a central Y-shaped structure 
and external channel (wrapper).
Each fuel plank contains an isostatically pressed carbon with fuel stripes 
on each plank's outer side.
The fuel stripes are prismatic regions composed of a graphite matrix filled with 
a cubic lattice of \gls{TRISO} particles. 
The core consists of 252 assemblies radially surrounded by reflectors
\cite{ramey_monte_2018}. 
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} details the specifications of the AHTR geometry
modeled in this proposed work.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Previous AHTR modeling efforts and challenges}
Modeling and simulation of the \gls{AHTR} design have been an ongoing effort 
since its conception in 2003 \cite{forsberg_molten-salt-cooled_2003}. 
The \gls{AHTR} core design differs significantly from the present \gls{LWR}-based 
nuclear power plants. 
These differences lead to modeling challenges and the need to verify and 
validate modeling and simulation methods \cite{ramey_monte_2018}. 
Verification and validation of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics tools' 
capability to successfully model the \gls{AHTR} design is a crucial step 
in support of licensure of the \gls{AHTR} design towards the eventual goal 
of deployment \cite{rahnema_phenomena_2019,rahnema_current_2015}. 
Several neutronic studies conducted along the way to the current \gls{AHTR} 
design have shed light on the technical challenges facing the design 
\cite{ramey_monte_2018,holcomb_fluoride_2013,greene_pre-conceptual_2010}. 


\gls{Georgia Tech} led an Integrated Research Project to 
understand challenges in \gls{FHR} materials', and modeling the neutronics and 
thermal-hydraulics in both plate and pebble fuelled \glspl{FHR} 
\cite{zhang_integrated_2019}. 
During the research project, a panel of subject matter experts came together to 
generate a \gls{PIRT} by identifying phenomena and ranking their importance.
The \gls{PIRT} identifies areas that need additional research to better 
understand important phenomena for adequate future modeling
\cite{rahnema_phenomena_2019}. 
Table \ref{tab:phenomena} lists the phenomena identified as requiring further 
research. 

\begin{table}[]

    \caption{\gls{PIRT} identified \gls{FHR} physical phenomena requiring further research

    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    \hline
    \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Phenomena} \\ \hline

    & - Boundary conditions for multigroup cross section generation \\ \hline 
    General Depletion & Spectral history \\ \hline 
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

The \gls{AHTR} has a complex core design due to the multiple heterogeneity 
present in the fuel introduced by \gls{TRISO} particles' presence embedded in 
plates \cite{ramey_monte_2018,rahnema_phenomena_2019}.
Accurately modeling the \gls{FHR}'s complex geometry with individual \gls{TRISO}
particle fidelity is necessary to obtain detailed reference power distributions 
to assess lower-fidelity models' accuracy.
However, it is challenging, particularly for deterministic codes that
use multigroup cross sections and traditional homogenization methods
\cite{ramey_monte_2018}. 
These traditional homogenization methods are insufficient to capture the correct physics 
in \glspl{FHR}, due to the multiple heterogeneity \cite{ramey_monte_2018}. 
In the \gls{AHTR}, single and multiple slab homogenization decreased computation time 
by 10; however they introduce a nontrivial error of $\sim$3\%
\cite{ramey_monte_2018,cisneros_neutronics_2012}.
To determine the feasibility and safety of the \gls{AHTR} design, we must 
calculate core physics parameters to an acceptable uncertainty. 
For Monte Carlo codes, increasing neutron histories reduces statistical 
uncertainty but comes at an increased computational cost.

Another technical challenge the \gls{AHTR} design faces is the uncertainty of 
the graphite and carbonaceous moderator material properties: densities, 
temperatures, and thermal scattering data.
Also, the thermal scattering data ($S(\alpha,\beta)$ matrices) for the bound 
nuclei in the \gls{FLiBe} salt are lacking \cite{ramey_monte_2018}. 
Mei et al. \cite{mei_investigation_2013} and Zhu et al. \cite{zhu_thermal_2017} 
examined the thermal scattering behavior of solid and liquid \gls{FLiBe}.
They concluded that the bound and free atom cross section of \gls{FLiBe} are 
identical above 0.1eV and diverges below 0.01eV, which means that the use or 
absence of thermal scattering data will impact the accuracy of the results 
\cite{ramey_monte_2018}. 

\subsection{AHTR Benchmark}
To address and further understand the technical challenges described 
in the previous section, in 2019, the OECD-NEA initiated a benchmark to assess the 
state of the art modeling and simulation capabilities for \glspl{FHR} with 
\gls{TRISO} fuel embedded in fuel plates ("planks") of hexagonal fuel elements
\cite{noauthor_fluoride_nodate}. 
The benchmark plans to have three phases, starting from a single fuel element 
simulation without burnup, gradually extending to full core depletion and feedback. 
The benchmark's overarching objective is to identify the applicability, accuracy, 
and practicality of the current methods and codes to assess the current state 
of the art of FHR simulation and modeling \cite{petrovic_preliminary_2021}. 
The benchmark also enables the cross-verification of codes and methodologies 
for the challenging \gls{AHTR} geometry, which is especially useful since 
applicable reactor physics experiments for code validation are scarce 
\cite{petrovic_fhrahtr_2019,petrovic_preliminary_2021}. 
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} will provide a detailed description of the 
benchmark phases and results obtained so far.

\section{Additive Manufacturing}
\gls{AM} is the formalized termed for what used to be called rapid prototyping 
and what is popularly called 3D printing \cite{gibson_additive_2014}. 
The basic principle of \gls{AM} is that a model is initially generated using a
\gls{3D CAD} system and is fabricated directly without the need for process 
planning. 
In \gls{AM}, the parts are made by adding materials in layers; each layer is a 
thin cross section of the \gls{3D CAD} designed part, as opposed 
to subtractive manufacturing methods such as traditional machining
\cite{standard_standard_2012}. 
All commercialized \gls{AM} machines to date use a layer-based approach, and 
the major ways that they differ are in materials, layer creation method, and 
how the layers are bonded to each other \cite{gibson_additive_2014}.
These major differences will determine the following factors: accuracy of the 
final part, material and mechanical properties, the time required to manufacture 
the part, the need for post-processing, size of \gls{AM} machine, and overall 
cost of the machine and the process \cite{gibson_additive_2014}. 
Initially, \gls{AM} was used to manufacture prototypes. 
However, with improvements in material properties, accuracy, and overall quality 
of \gls{AM} output, the applications for \gls{AM} expanded to the 
current point in which some industries build parts for direct assembly purposes
\cite{uriondo_present_2015}.  
Furthermore, using \gls{AM} in conjunction with other technologies, such as 
high-power laser technology, has enabled \gls{AM} technology 
to manufacture parts made from various metals \cite{gibson_additive_2014}. 

\subsection{Application of Additive Manufacturing to Nuclear Reactor Core Components}
\label{sec:am}
\gls{AM} has progressed rapidly in the last 30 years, from rapid design prototyping 
with polymers in the automotive industry to scale production of metal components.  
Examples include Boeing using \gls{AM} to reduce the 979 Dreamliner's weight 
\cite{noauthor_printed_2017} and General Electric using \gls{AM} to produce fuel 
injection nozzles \cite{noauthor_transformation_2018}. 
The most common metal \gls{AM} technologies, \gls{SLM}, \gls{EBM}, \gls{L-DED}, 
and binder jetting, are not currently used to manufacture nuclear power plant parts. 
Wide-spread adoption of these methods in the nuclear industry could drastically 
reduce fabrication costs and timelines, combine multiple systems and assembled 
components into single parts, increase safety and performance by tailoring 
local material properties, and enable geometry redesign for optimal load paths 
\cite{simpson_considerations_2019}. 
Many generation IV advanced reactor concepts have complex geometries, 
such as hex-ducts for sodium-cooled fast reactors, that are costly and difficult 
to fabricate using standard processing techniques. 
Traditional manufacturing routes also restrict the viable geometries for 
reactor designers \cite{sridharan_performance_2019}. 
In summary, the main benefits of using \gls{AM} for reactor core components is that 
we are no longer geometrically constrained by conventional fuel manufacturing 
and can further optimize and improve fuel geometries to enhance fuel performance and 
safety with the added benefit of lower cost \cite{bergeron_early_2018}. 

Experimental work in the nuclear materials field demonstrates the application 
of \gls{AM} to nuclear fuel and structural core material fabrication. 
Bergeron et al. \cite{bergeron_early_2018} successfully demonstrated additively 
manufacturing thorium dioxide using a stereolithography-based 3D printer 
and photopolymer resin. 
The high-density thorium dioxide objects were printed and sintered to densities 
of $\sim90\%$ \cite{bergeron_early_2018}. 
Rosales et al. \cite{rosales_characterizing_2019} conducted a feasibility study 
of direct routes to fabricate dense uranium silicide ($U_3Si_2$) fuel pellets 
using the \gls{INL} invented \gls{AMAFT}. 
$U_3Si_2$ is an accident-tolerant nuclear fuel candidate due to its
high uranium density and improved thermal properties. 
Its current metallurgical fabrication process is expensive and long; the goal of
\gls{AMAFT} is to fabricate $U_3Si_2$ at a lower cost in a timely and
commercially-reliable manner \cite{rosales_characterizing_2019}.  
Sridharan et al. \cite{sridharan_performance_2019} demonstrated the application of
the laser-blown-powder \gls{AM} process to fabricate \gls{FM} steel, a type of 
steel commonly used for cladding and structural components in nuclear reactors. 
Koyanagi et al. \cite{koyanagi_additive_2020} presented \gls{AM} technology's 
current status for manufacturing nuclear-grade \gls{SiC} materials; they 
demonstrated that combinations of \gls{AM} techniques and traditional \gls{SiC} 
densification methods enabled new designs of \gls{SiC} components with complex shapes. 
\gls{SiC} has excellent strength at elevated temperatures, chemical inertness, 
relatively low neutron absorption, and stability under neutron irradiation up 
to high doses \cite{sauder_ceramic_2014, snead_handbook_2007,koyanagi_additive_2020}. 
These qualities make \gls{SiC} suitable for many applications in nuclear systems 
such as fuel cladding, constituents of fuel particles \cite{snead_handbook_2007} 
and pellets \cite{terrani_progress_2015}, core structural components in fission 
reactors \cite{sauder_ceramic_2014}. 

\section{Nuclear Reactor Design Optimization}
\label{sec:opt}
The practice of nuclear reactor optimization has been around since the conception of 
nuclear reactors. 
Optimization has been applied to nuclear reactor design, reactor reloading 
patterns, and the nuclear fuel cycle.  
In the proposed work, we will focus on the optimization of nuclear reactor 
core design. 
Previous efforts towards nuclear reactor core design optimization include
deterministic and stochastic optimization techniques and these optimization 
methods coupled with surrogate models. 

Deterministic optimization methods usually start from a guess solution;
then, the algorithm suggests a search direction based on applying local 
information to a pre-specified transition rule. 
The best solution becomes the new solution, and the above procedure continues 
several timess \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
Drawbacks of deterministic methods include: algorithms tend to get stuck to a 
suboptimal solution, and an algorithm efficient in solving one type of problem 
may not solve a different problem efficiently \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
Stochastic optimization methods minimize or maximize an objective function 
when randomness is present; they tend to find globally optimal solutions 
more reliably than deterministic methods. 
Evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing are examples of stochastic 
optimization algorithms. 

A nuclear reactor's complexity results in reactor design optimization being a 
multi-objective design problem requiring a tradeoff between desirable 
attributes \cite{byrne_evolving_2014,simon_sciences_2019}. 
When multiple conflicting objectives are important, there is no single optimum 
solution that simultaneously optimizes all objectives. 
Instead, the multi-objective optimization problem's outcome is a set of optimal 
solutions with varying degree objective values \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
For a multi-objective problem like reactor design optimization, 
an ideal multi-objective optimization method should find widely spread solutions 
in the obtained non-dominated front \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 

Recent efforts towards nuclear reactor optimization have relied heavily on 
stochastic methods such as simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms, 
with the occasional addition of stochastic-deterministic hybrid methods. 
Sacco et al. \cite{sacco_two_2006,sacco_metropolis_2008} used stochastic 
simulated annealing and deterministic-stochastic hybrid optimization techniques 
to optimize reactor dimensions, enrichment, materials, etc., in order to 
minimize the average peak factor in a three-enrichment-zone reactor. 
Odeh et al. \cite{odeh_core_2016} used the simulated annealing stochastic algorithm 
coupled with neutronics and thermal-hydraulics codes, \gls{PARCS} and RELAP5, 
to develop an optimum \gls{NMR-50} core design to achieve a 10-year cycle length 
with minimal fissile loading. 
Kropaczek et al. \cite{kropaczek_large-scale_2019} demonstrated the constraint 
annealing method, a highly scalable method based on the method of parallel 
simulated annealing with mixing of states \cite{kropaczek_constraint_2019}, for 
the solution of large-scale, multiconstrained problems in \gls{LWR} fuel cycle 
optimization. 
Peireira et al. \cite{pereira_coarse-grained_2003,pereira_parallel_2008} 
used a coarse-grained parallel \gls{GA} and a niching \gls{GA}
to optimize the same problem as \cite{sacco_two_2006}. 
Kamalpour et al. \cite{kamalpour_smart_2020} utilized the imperialist competitive 
algorithm, a type of evolutionary algorithm, to optimize an \gls{FCM} fuelled 
\gls{PWR} to extend the reactor core cycle length. 

Nuclear reactor optimization problems require computationally 
extensive neutronics and thermal-hydraulics software to compute the objective 
function and constraints. 
Multiple papers utilized optimization methods with surrogate models to replace 
computationally-expensive high fidelity neutronics or thermal hydraulics 
simulations to reduce the computational cost of utilizing stochastic methods.
Kumar et al. \cite{kumar_new_2015} combined genetic algorithm optimization 
with regression splines surrogate model to optimize a reactor model for 
high breeding of U-233 and Pu-239 in desired power peaking limits, desired 
keff using the following parameters: radius of a fuel pin cell, isotopic enrichment 
of the fissile material in the fuel, the mass flow rate of the coolant, and 
temperature of the coolant at the core inlet.
Betzler et al. \cite{betzler_design_2019} developed a systematic approach to 
build a surrogate model to serve in place of high-fidelity computational 
analyses. 
They leveraged the surrogate model with a simulated annealing optimization 
algorithm to generate optimized designs at a lower computational cost to 
understand design decisions' impact on desired metrics for \gls{HFIR} \gls{LEU} 
core designs.

The simulation annealing method uses a point-by-point approach. 
One solution gets updated to a new solution in one iteration, which does not 
exploit parallel systems' advantages.
Finding an optimal solution with simulation annealing methods will take very 
long if high-fidelity computationally expensive codes are used to compute 
the objective function and constraints.
Therefore, using the simulation annealing method is only practical if a 
surrogate evaluation model is used as described in \cite{betzler_design_2019}
and \cite{kumar_new_2015}.
Evolutionary algorithm methods mimic nature's evolutionary principles to drive 
its search towards an optimal solution. 

Contrary to a single solution per iteration in deterministic and stochastic 
simulation annealing methods, \glspl{EA} use a population of solutions in each 
iteration \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
With the affordability and availability of parallel computing systems, the 
evolutionary algorithm optimization method stands out as a method 
that easily and conveniently exploits parallel systems. 
Further, \glspl{EA} have proved amenable to \gls{HPC} solutions and 
scalable to tens of thousands of processors \cite{kropaczek_constraint_2019}. 
Therefore, in this proposed work, we will utilize the evolutionary algorithm 
optimization method. 

\subsection{Impact of Additive Manufacturing on Nuclear Reactor Design 
Optimization}
In section \ref{sec:am}, we discussed how, with the advancements of \gls{AM} 
for reactor core components, reactor designers are no longer geometrically 
constrained by conventional fuel manufacturing and can further optimize and 
improve fuel geometries to enhance fuel performance and safety. 
Reactor design objectives remain consistent with past objectives, such as 
minimizing fuel amount and minimizing the maximum fuel temperature for a given 
power level.
However, we can now approach the nuclear design problems with truly arbitrary 
geometries, no longer limited by traditional geometric shapes that are 
easy to manufacture with traditional processes: slabs as fuel plates, cylinders 
as fuel rods, spheres as fuel pebbles, axis-aligned coolant channels, etc  
\cite{sobes_artificial_2020}.
Therefore, this has opened the door for a re-examination of optimization in a 
completely new way, determining the optimal arbitrary geometry for a given objective 
function \cite{sobes_artificial_2020} with a much smaller set of constraints. 

With a substantial increase and change in an arbitrary geometry's design space, 
it becomes time-consuming for a human reactor designer to thoroughly explore 
and find optimal geometries in the expanded design space. 
Instead, we can leverage \gls{AI} optimization methods such as \gls{EA} to 
promptly explore the large design space to find global optimal designs. 
\gls{AI} would not replace the human reactor designer but shifts the human 
designer's focus away from conjecturing suitable geometries to defining design 
criteria to find optimal designs \cite{sobes_artificial_2020}. 
Therefore, when the human designer changes the reactor criteria, the \gls{AI} 
model will quickly adapt and produce new global optimal designs to fit the new 
criteria.  

\section{Evolutionary Algorithms} 
\glspl{EA} mimic natural evolutionary principles to constitute search and 
optimization procedures \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
Evolutionary algorithms often perform well at approximating solutions to many 
problem types because they do not make any assumptions about the 
underlying fitness landscape.
The most popular \glspl{EA} used to solve multi-objective problems are genetic 
algorithms (GA) \cite{byrne_evolving_2014, krish_practical_2011}. 

\subsection{Genetic Algorithms}
\glspl{GA} imitate natural genetics and selection to evolve solutions 
by maintaining a population of solutions, allowing 
fitter solutions to reproduce, and letting lesser fit solutions die off, 
resulting in final solutions that are better than the previous generations 
\cite{renner_genetic_2003}. 
From here, we will refer to a solution as an individual within the population. 
\glspl{GA} efficiently exploit historical information to speculate new search 
points, improving each subsequent population's performance 
\cite{goldberg_genetic_1989}. 
\glspl{GA} are theoretically and empirically proven to provide robust 
search in complex spaces and are computationally simple yet powerful 
in their search for improvement \cite{goldberg_genetic_1989}. 
GAs are advantageous compared to deterministic and stochastic simulated 
annealing optimization methods because (1) it searches from a population of 
points, (2) uses objective function information, not derivatives or other 
auxiliary knowledge of the problem, and (3) uses probabilistic transition 
rules, not deterministic rules. 
Figure \ref{fig:genetic_alg} depicts the iterative process of using a \gls{GA}
to solve a problem. 
The \gls{GA} generates new populations iteratively until it meets the termination 
criteria.

% explain how individuals look like 

\glspl{GA} uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution such as selection, 
crossover, and mutation. 
The three operators are simple and straightforward. 
The selection operator selects good individuals. 
The crossover operator recombines together good individuals to form a better 
individual. 
The mutation operator alters individuals to create a better individual 
\cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
In the subsequent section, we will provide more description and common methods 
for each operator.

\subsubsection{Selection Operator}
The selection operator's primary objective is to duplicate good 
individuals and eliminate bad individuals while keeping the population 
constant \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
It achieves this by identifying above-average individuals in a population, 
eliminating bad individuals from the population, and replacing them with 
copies of good individuals.
Selection operator methods utilized in the proposed work include tournament 
selection, best selection, and NSGA-II selection. 
In tournament selection, tournaments are played between a user-defined number 
of individuals, and the best individual is kept in the population. 
This repeatedly occurs until all the population's spots are filled. 
In best selection, a user-defined number of best individuals are selected, 
and copies are made to keep population size constant. 
In NSGA-II selection, parent and offspring populations are combined, and the
best individuals (with respect to fitness and spread) are selected
\cite{deb_fast_2002}.
Copies of the best individuals are made to keep 
population size constant. 

The selection operator cannot create any new individuals in the population 
and only makes more copies of good individuals at the expense of not-so-good
individuals. 
The crossover and mutation operators perform the creation of new solutions.

\subsubsection{Crossover Operator}
The crossover operator is also known as the mating operator. 
In most crossover operators, two individuals are picked from the population at 
random, and some portion of the individuals' attributes are exchanged with one 
another to create two new individuals \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
Crossover operator methods utilized in the proposed work include single-point
crossover, uniform crossover, and blend crossover. 
In the single-point crossover, two individuals are selected from the population,
and a site along the individual's definition is randomly chosen. 
Attributes on this cross site's right side are exchanged between the two 
individuals, creating two new offspring individuals.  
In a uniform crossover, the user defines an independent probability for each 
individual's attribute to be exchanged; usually, $p=0.5$ is used. 
In blend crossover, two offspring (O) individuals are created based on a linear 
combination of two-parent (P) individuals using the following equations: 

\begin{align}
    O_1 &= P_1 - \alpha(P_1-P_2) \\
    O_2 &= P_2 + \alpha(P_1-P_2)
\intertext{where}
\alpha &= \mbox{Extent of the interval in which the new values can be drawn} \nonumber \\
 & \mbox{for each attribute on both side of the parents’ attributes (user-defined)} \nonumber 
\end{align}

To preserve some good individuals selected during the selection 
operator stage, not all individuals are used in a crossover; this is implemented 
by having the user define a crossover probability ($p_c$).  
Therefore, the crossover operator is only applied to $100p_c\%$ of the 
population; the rest are copied to the new population
\cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 

The crossover operator is mainly responsible for the search aspect of the 
\glspl{GA}, whereas the mutation operator is needed to keep diversity 
in the population \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 

\subsubsection{Mutation Operator}
The mutation operator alters one or more attributes of an individual within 
a population. 
Mutation occurs in the \gls{GA} based on a user-defined mutation probability 
($p_m$) that is set low to prevent a primitive random search. 
Mutation operator methods utilized in the proposed work include polynomial 
bounded mutation. 
In polynomial bounded mutation, each attribute in each individual is mutated 
based on a polynomial distribution. 
The user also defines each attribute's upper and lower bounds and the 
crowding-degree of the mutation, $\eta$ (large $\eta$ will produce a mutant 
resembling its parent, while a small $\eta$ will produce the opposite).  

\subsection{Balancing Genetic Algorithm Hyperparameters}
In the proposed work, hyperparameters refer to parameters whose value controls 
the \gls{GA}'s process, such as each genetic operator's associated parameters 
and population size.  
A good optimization method needs to balance the extent of exploration of 
information obtained until the current generation through the crossover 
and mutation operators with the extent of exploitation through the selection
operator. 
If previously obtained individuals are exploited too much, the population loses 
its diversity, and premature convergence to a sub-optimal solution is expected. 
Whereas if too much stress is given on exploration, the information obtained 
thus far has not been appropriately utilized, and the \gls{GA}'s search procedure 
behaves like a random search process \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
A quantitative balance between these two issues, exploitation and exploration, 
is challenging to achieve. 
Deb et al. \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001} and Goldberg et al. 
\cite{goldberg_toward_1993} quantified the relationship between exploitation 
and exploration. 
They found that for the one-max test problem, in which the objective is to 
maximize the number of 1s in a string, a \gls{GA} with any arbitrary 
hyperparameter setting does not work well even on a simple problem. 
Only \glspl{GA} with a selection pressure, s, and crossover probability, $p_c$, 
falling inside the control map (figure \ref{fig:controlmap}), find the desired 
optimum.  


\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{controlmap.png} 
    \caption{Simulation results of the region in which the \gls{GA} will find the 
    desired optimum for the one-max problem 
    \cite{goldberg_toward_1993,deb_multi-objective_2001}.}
    \label{fig:controlmap}
\end{figure}

Another consideration is the population size, a function with considerable 
variability in objective function values demands a large population size to 
find a global optimum \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. 
Therefore, finding an optimized solution with \glspl{GA} requires the user 
to conduct a hyperparameter search. 
Ng et al. \cite{ng_improving_2021} suggest that a coarse to fine sampling scheme 
is the best way to perform a systematic hyperparameter search.  
For a two-dimensional example of a coarse to fine sampling scheme, the user 
first does a coarse sample of the entire square. 
A fine search is then conducted on the best-performing region of the coarse 
search. 

\section{Summary}
This chapter provided a literature review of relevant past research 
efforts that give context to this proposed work.
In summary, additive manufacturing of nuclear reactor components is a quickly 
developing field thanks to the aerospace and auto industries, which led to 
breakthroughs in \gls{AM} fabrication of metal components. 
The promise of cheaper and faster manufacturing of reactor components with 
\gls{AM} frees complex reactor geometries from previous manufacturing constraints
and allows reactor designers to reexamine reactor design optimization.  
Stochastic optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms have proven to 
work well for finding global optimums in multi-objective design problems such as 
nuclear reactor optimization and can be leveraged to explore the vast exploration 
design space enabled by \gls{AM}.
