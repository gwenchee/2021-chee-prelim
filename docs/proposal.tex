The need for this work is shown by a summary of how additive manufacturing 
of nuclear reactor core components frees complex reactor geometries from 
previous manufacturing constraints enabling reactor designers to reexamine 
reactor core design optimization.
The literature review (Chapter \ref{chap:lit-review}) concluded that stochastic 
evolutionary algorithm optimization methods can be leveraged to find global 
optimums for reactor design problems in the vast exploration design space 
enabled by additive manufacturing. 
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} introduced the \acrfull{AHTR} benchmark and 
highlighted the reactor's benefits such as passive safety behavior with negative 
temperature coefficients. 
In Chapter \ref{chap:realm}, I introduced the \acrfull{REALM} software package 
which applies evolutionary algorithm optimization techniques to nuclear 
reactor design. 
Chapter \ref{chap:realm-demo} demonstrated successfully applying \gls{REALM} 
to optimize the \gls{TRISO} packing fraction distribution in an \gls{AHTR} slab. 

Based on what I learnt from the preliminary work conducted, this chapter proposes 
future simulations categorized into two groups: \gls{AHTR} development and 
\gls{REALM} optimization. 
For \gls{AHTR} development, I propose the following simulations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{AHTR} 3D full core neutronics OpenMC simulation
    \item \gls{AHTR} fuel slab and one-third fuel assembly multiphysics 
    Moltres simulation
\end{itemize}
For \gls{REALM} optimization, I propose the following \gls{REALM} simulations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{AHTR} slab geometry optimization to maximize $k_{eff}$, 
    minimize power peaking, and maximize heat transfer by varying \gls{TRISO} 
    x-axis distribution and \gls{FLiBe} channel shape using OpenMC. 
    \item \gls{AHTR} one-third fuel assembly optimization to maximize $k_{eff}$, 
    minimize power peaking, and maximize heat transfer by varying \gls{TRISO} 
    xy axes distribution and \gls{FLiBe} channel shape using OpenMC.
\end{itemize}
The \gls{REALM} simulations proposed might be extended to include Moltres 
evaluations if the \gls{AHTR} development Moltres simulations find approximations 
and assumptions that maintain accuracy while keeping acceptable Moltres runtimes.

\section{AHTR Development}
The \gls{FHR} benchmark introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} is an 
ongoing project to assess the modeling and simulation capabilities for the 
\gls{AHTR}. 
The contributions to date from benchmark participants', including the 
\gls{UIUC} team, are Phases I-A and I-B (2D assembly steady state and 
depletion).  
The upcoming phases consist of 3D neutronics models and multiphysics models. 
Thus, in an effort to support the \gls{FHR} benchmark, the proposed work will 
complete the benchmark's Phase I-C.
In preparation for the later multiphysics benchmark phases, the proposed work
will utilize Moltres to model the multi-physics for a smaller section of the 
\gls{AHTR} geometry.
