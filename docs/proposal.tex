The need for this work is shown by a summary of how additive manufacturing 
of nuclear reactor core components frees complex reactor geometries from 
previous manufacturing constraints enabling reactor designers to reexamine 
reactor core design optimization.
The literature review (Chapter \ref{chap:lit-review}) concluded that stochastic 
evolutionary algorithm optimization methods can be leveraged to find global 
optimums for reactor design problems in the vast exploration design space 
enabled by additive manufacturing. 
Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} introduced the \acrfull{AHTR} benchmark and 
highlighted the reactor's benefits such as passive safety behavior with negative 
temperature coefficients. 
In Chapter \ref{chap:realm}, I introduced the \acrfull{REALM} software package 
which applies evolutionary algorithm optimization techniques to nuclear 
reactor design. 
Chapter \ref{chap:realm-demo} demonstrated successfully applying \gls{REALM} 
to optimize the \gls{TRISO} packing fraction distribution in an \gls{AHTR} slab. 

Based on what I learnt from the preliminary work conducted, this chapter proposes 
future simulations categorized into two groups: \gls{AHTR} development and 
\gls{REALM} optimization. 
For \gls{AHTR} development, I propose the following simulations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{AHTR} 3D full core neutronics OpenMC simulation
    \item \gls{AHTR} fuel slab and one-third fuel assembly multiphysics 
    Moltres simulation
\end{itemize}
For \gls{REALM} optimization, I propose the following \gls{REALM} simulations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{AHTR} slab geometry optimization to maximize $k_{eff}$, 
    minimize power peaking, and maximize heat transfer by varying \gls{TRISO} 
    x-axis distribution and \gls{FLiBe} channel shape using OpenMC. 
    \item \gls{AHTR} one-third fuel assembly optimization to maximize $k_{eff}$, 
    minimize power peaking, and maximize heat transfer by varying \gls{TRISO} 
    xy axes distribution and \gls{FLiBe} channel shape using OpenMC.
\end{itemize}
The \gls{REALM} simulations proposed might be extended to include Moltres 
evaluations if the \gls{AHTR} development Moltres simulations find approximations 
and assumptions that maintain accuracy while keeping acceptable Moltres runtimes.

\section{AHTR Development}
The \gls{FHR} benchmark introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:fhr-benchmark} is an 
ongoing \gls{NEA} project to assess the modeling and simulation capabilities 
for the \gls{AHTR}. 
Benchmark participants', including the \gls{UIUC} team, contributed Phases I-A 
and I-B (2D assembly steady state and depletion) so far.  
The upcoming phases consist of 3D neutronics models and multiphysics models. 
Thus, in an effort to support the \gls{FHR} benchmark, the proposed work will 
complete the benchmark's Phase I-C.
Also, in preparation for the later multiphysics benchmark phases, the proposed 
work will utilize Moltres to model the multi-physics for a smaller section of 
the \gls{AHTR} geometry. 

\subsection{\gls{FHR} Benchmark Phase I-C}
The \gls{FHR} benchmark's Phase I-C extends the 2D assembly model from Phases 
I-A and I-B into a 3D assembly model. 
The benchmark organizer's will release Phase I-C's detailed specifications and 
required results in June 2021.

\subsection{\gls{AHTR} Multiphysics Model}
I will use the open source simulation tool, Moltres, to conduct multiphysics 
simulations of the \gls{AHTR}. 
Moltres, an application built atop the \gls{MOOSE} parallel finite element 
framework \cite{gaston_moose:_2009}, contains physics kernels and boundary 
conditions to solve arbitrary-group deterministic neutron diffusion and 
thermal-hydraulics \glspl{PDE} simultaneously on a single mesh
\cite{lindsay_introduction_2018,park_advancement_2020}. 
\gls{AHTR} Moltres simulations will capture thermal feedback effects, absent
from the purely neutronics OpenMC simulations.  
% say stuff about Cole gentry's paper/phd. Multiphysics 

In past effort towards multiphysics modeling of the \gls{AHTR}, Gentry et al 
\cite{gentry_development_2016} utilized Serpent \cite{leppanen_serpent_2014} 
and NESTLE


\section{REALM Optimization}
Chapter \ref{chap:realm-demo} demonstrated \gls{REALM}'s success with the
demonstration problem, and concluded that the problem should be further
developed by considering other objectives such as maximizing heat transfer and 
minimizing power peaking in the core. 
In the proposed work, I will explore each objective separately and then together.
Table \ref{tab:objectives} describes each objective and how the objective will 
be quantified.
