\chapter{Future Work and Proposed Simulations}
% Main Gist 
% - My planned work
% Structure 
% - Stage 1: Tune hyperparameters for moltres problem
% - Stage 2: Demonstration of realm with moltres with complicated problem 
% - Stage 3: Evaluate the moltres' heat transfer interface and improve on it


% multi objective -> maximize keff, minimize power peaking / maximize heat transfer 
% These ideas lead into the proposal section 

% IDEAS 
% vary in y direction 
% try the whole 1/3 diamond fuel elemt
